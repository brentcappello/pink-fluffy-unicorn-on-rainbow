This is my lightning talk at RailsGirls Singapore, 28 June 2014. 

I wanted to demonstrate how coding can be fun and that it's OK to start not knowing how to achieve everything you want and get help from Google/StackOverFlow.

### Run it

`ruby unicorn.rb`

### Check out the steps

`git checkout step-1` (there are 5 steps in total)
